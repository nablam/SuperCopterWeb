The Early Times
North Africa in the 90*s was pretty good but not stellar. Toy stores were not the priority for developing countries at that time, but since my family traveled often to France for winter vacations, I was able to get Lego sets. I had to be creative and build the toys I wanted. Many times, I had to disassemble my favorite current toy in order to build a new one. I spent most vacation days drawing, building toys, or watching tv. I grew up in a house where video games were almost taboo for some weird reason. One day I was in a hotel bar/restaurant with my parents, and noticed an Arcade machine. There was a definite look of panic in their eyes saying ~oh no this is not for you, but it*s too late since you*ve seen one already^. I had already run to the machine, and it was glorious. I don*t remember what game was playing, there were so many colors and works and animations. My parents convinced me that I didn*t need coins to play. I was allowed to move the joysticks and click the buttons pretending I was really playing.

Discovering Electricity
I was reaching the limits of what was possible to create with a limited Lego set. I started experimenting with fusing Lego with cardboard extensions. One day I opened a broken Walkman with the idea of pulling out the motor and integrate it to my Lego. I built a Lego plane with a motorized propeller. I would hold the plane with my fingers and connect two exposed wires together and the propeller would spin. I was hooked. I started scavenging basic components like motors, light bulbs, and wires from any junked electronics I could get my hands on.

Playing With Motors
My parents had a subscription to ~sciences et vie^ a monthly French science magazine which was one of the few foreign subscriptions allowed in Algeria at the time. I was a fan of the DIY electronic experiments. They provided schematics and explanations for building gadgets like a traffic signal, buzzers and Christmas tree light strobe.  I added resistors, capacitors, diodes and transistors to my list of scavenged parts. My Lego creations were upgraded with blinking lights, motors. Moving to a new school, I found the only other kid who like me enjoyed electronics. His dad was and electrical engineer and had a home shop stacked with equipment, schematics, and tons of cool stuff. My friend and I build a remote control from scratch (blindly following a schematic) and since I was the one with the Lego, I also build a chassis. We were now the only kids in town with a remote-controlled car.

Electronics And Circuits
My dad was very well connected back then. He personally knew a few university professors and presidents, and I was able to attend the local after school university*s electronics design class at a young age. It was fun playing with multimeters and oscilloscopes, and have access to a plethora of components, but I remember feeling blank, mentally drained, and confused when the topics evolved to digital circuits and high math analysis. I was barely entering junior high, and was already attending two schools (I was also home schooled). My math level was higher than my peers but I was still not calculus level. Despite that I still kept taking notes knowing that I would one day be able to shed light on them once I learned Calculus and differential equations.

Programming In Basic
Introduced to GW basic at a local ~informatic center^. One of if not the first programming center in my town for adults. Once again, my dad*s buddy was the program administrator, and I was allowed to attend the course. Thinking back as I am writing this blog, I was rather privileged as a child and didn*t even know it. I remember going in early to be able to use the IBMs to play a few minutes of Price or Persia, the goonies, and river run before the class started. This was the only other place where I had access to playing a real video game. Sure, there were coffee places in town that had arcades, there even was an actual arcade venue stacked with dozens of cabinets, but these were not places I was allowed to go. They were primarily frequented by delinquents and other types of folks that my parents would try to keep me away from. I did manage to sneak in a few times, and my parents were right. Illegal gambling was rampant, and often a video game contest would turn into a real knife fight and full-on brawls in the venues.

Early Drawing Years
Drawing had been my main passion, pass time, and escape ever since I can remember. In fact, one of my oldest memories are from a drawing session in kindergarten. We were drawing a tennis scene, and I remember getting upset when my teacher asked me to draw the court as a rectangle like everyone else instead of a trapezoid. I was trying to draw in perspective but could verbalize it. The teacher kept saying that tennis courts are rectangles, and could not explain that side lines should taper toward a focal point. (I wish I could have said it this way back thenâ€¦). My drawing abilities were more advanced than my peers, and so I would always be asked to draw my friends* favorite cartoon characters, which I gladly did as they were also my favorites. I had drawn two 25page ninja turtle comic books, and was crating mini flip books by drawing animated stick figures in the corners of all my school books. I was experimenting with motion, and visual language without even knowing it. I would make animations of a heavy stick figure running sluggishly, and contrast that with a thin fit stick figure lightly striding. I was also fascinated by destruction. I would take many days creating flip book animations of intricate structures and buildings collapsing with every detail of blocks and rebar falling and crumbling. Ironically, all this work was lost in the rubbles of an actual earth quake in 1997.

Lost School Year
The Berbers were the lands natives. After centuries of colonization*s and wars, the final adopted language became Arabic and it was taught in schools while French was a secondary language. Depending on the region, people spoke a mixture of North African Arabic with some French, or Berber with some French. In 94, the Berber declared that their language should also be part of the school curriculum. The government at the time would systematically block any of the proposals made the Berbers. The students and teachers in Berber regions collectively decided to go on strike. The strike lasted an entire school year.

The Big Move
The political situation in Algeria had been rather unstable since 92, and it was getting worst. My parents had been preparing a move for a year in secret. One random day I was coming back home from school for lunch when my dad announced the big move. Needless to say, that it came as huge shock. I would be transferred to an America high school, and had to take extensive ESL classes.

Programming Again
My math level was high enough to get into advanced placement math classes two grades above. Ap calc required a graphing calculator. It may not sound like much today, but at the time, the leap in technology between a regular calculator and a Graphing one is equivalent to that between a dumb phone and a smart one. There was a very interesting button labeled ~PROG^ ! I re discovered the joys of automating electronic devices with programming. I build break out and it was running at about 3 frames per second, but it was glorious. I was recreating short stick figure animations, and I could even share my programs with other students using a connector cord.

Modelling In 3D
I don*t remember how I got introduced to OpenFx. It was certainly not a product of an internet search. I was running Windows98 and AOL, Netscape and Internet-Explorer were all the rage. OpenFx is a very clunky mesh editor compared other modeling software at the time, but it was Free-Ware.

Wentworth Institute of Technology offers a coop program. I interned at a locale design firm, and was working on various graphic design projects. It was a very fast passed environment. The team was small and the contracts were enormous! All in all, it was a great time. My boss was French designer living in a fancy downtown Boston apartment, which also served as a design studio. I was the youngest recruit, and since I also was a technology enthusiast, I was given the task of IT related issues on top of my graphic design tasks. I put together the office website, an it looks like it hasn*t changed since one of the projects was to create an orientation table, and I happen to walk by it while visiting New York years after its installation.

A Taste Of Business school
I decided to pursue and MBA â€¦ what was I thinking. At the time it seemed like a logical decision. I was thinking about getting into the business side of things, and maybe start a design firm someday. My buddy Doug was interested in real estate and was studying for the GMATs so I tagged along study sessions with him and passed the test. The real test was finding a true interest in business. I learned that business is none of my business lol. I remember going to class, taking notes, and dealing with trivial business math. I studied what was necessary for passing tests and that was it. I never felt the drive and curiosity to dive deeper in the concepts learned in class. The passion was clearly missing.

Making A Mobile Game
Sam (my road trip buddy) and Chris and Mike, were starting an IPhone game LLC. Sam and I met in design school so he was the ~designers^, Chris was a computer engineering major at the same school, so he was the ~developer^ and Mike was Sam*s home town friend. He was the ~business^ guy. Sam and I would build assets for a tower defense game, Chris would put it together in Cocos, and Mike dealt with all the paperwork. Time went on, and the efforts on the project slowly dwindled. All of us had jobs and a life to tend to. Although this project is stagnating, we all remained very good friends.

Computer Science
While working on our tower defense game, I started looking at Cocos and modern coding in general. I started diving deeper and learning objective c on my own and quickly realized that I was inefficiently progressing through a seemingly endless virtual rabbit hole of Wikipedia links, and YouTube tutorials. I was stuck in recursive comp sci topic loop a where every topic required prerequisite topics, and I could not find the termination argument. I needed to find an environment where I could learn these topics but also get direct answers to my questions. Luckily, I was still employed at BU, and would still benefit from tuition remission and this time I would use It on a Masters in Computer science.

BSSC
I started skiing in the French Alps in 87. I was living in Algeria, but my parents regularly traveled to France for winter vacations. I didn*t do any winter activities between 96 and 04, when I met Mark M. A college dorm mate who needed a riding buddy. He had a spare snowboard and boots, and asked me if I rodeâ€¦ to which I answered with no hesitation: yes. On the road to Attitash Me, I remember thinking to myself: How long can I *ride* this lie? (Pun very much intended). The answer was: as soon as I have to get off the chairlift. After taking a stereotypical chairlift spill, I had to confess. Mark M. told me that he knew it was going to be a long day the moment he watched unload the boards from the car. I was riding almost every weekend, and every winter from then on. This is obviously is not a cheap hobby, and a broke college student has to find ways around this issue.  Some more legal than others. One of the sustainable legal solutions was to become a ski bus guide. I joined the Boston Ski and Sports Club, and soon became a weekend day trip chaperone. We would start the day at 5:30 am loading the bus, then sleep on the way up north. I could ride all day for free! In 2012 I was upgraded to weekend chaperone. I met Julie on my first weekend trip and we have been inseparable since then.

VinnyAutonomous Robot
This is probably one of my first projects involving Arduino microcontrollers. I had need building small circuits using a single sessor, but most of the work was a replication of some tutorial. Vinny was the first complete microcontroller project. Vinny is an autonomous object avoiding Lego rover. I built the chassis using two Lego motors and Lego tank treads. Each motor drives a tread and the whole thing maneuvers like a tank would: when both treads cycle in the same direction, the rover will advance in the same direction. When treads cycle in opposite direction, the rover turns. The rover is equipped with three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. One is positioned facing the front of the rover, and the other two are placed on the front corners at a 45-degree angle. The code is pretty straight forward: - a sensor emits an ultrasonic wave every T time periods, and starts a timer.-If a signal is received within the T period, the timer is read - and a distance to obstacle is calculated - the same process is run on all three sensors - the result distance readings are stored in an array for analysis. Analysis and locomotion:This is solved with a simple switch case loop-While the front distance is null (no obstacle was detected) keep moving forward-If front distance falls below a threshold change state to obstacle Detected  - Then compare the side distances-Start with sensor on the right (totally arbitrary but I decided Vinny was a righty) -If right distance is null, then turn right  -Else turn left

I majored in comp sci with a minor in security, so networking was major subject. Unlike business school, comp sci subject always piqued my curiosity, and I was always applying learned concepts in my personal projects.

Algorithms were still on my mind, and I had the Idea to use DFS to create optimal guest seating arrangements. Inevitably, this list was vetoed by Julie, but was still used as a base diagram. I took the list of all our gussets and built a simple weighted relationship map for each person. Using a relationship scaler value k, Julie and I went through the guest list to produce a new list of elements in the form of Alice ->k->Bob. K=4 they hang out together K=3 they hang out together only when one of us is around K=2 they are acquainted  K=1never met A relationship graph is generated using this new list as input and we travel the graph using DFS. The residual subgraphs represent islands of guests who know each other. Something like that, I don*t remember the details

My first smart phone. Yeah, I*ve been the center of many jokes for being a cs student while still rocking a dumb phone. My answer has always been that I didn*t need a smart phone yet. I remember the time I use to dump into programming a TI83, and that I should not get distracted by mobile development while still in school.  Now I got a sweet pocket computer with internet access on the go! I could even install a light IDE and code for fun while commuting to work on the train. I was firmware believer â€¦ I mean, a firm believer in owning one*s hardware, and I would systematically root my phones, clear the bloat-ware, and sleep with a smile on my face knowing that my smart phone belongs to me (provided I don*t use the SIM and stay on my own network) . I start exploring Android development. Unity has an easy Android build deployment system, so I figured I would start there before playing with native development. I wanted to build an Android game and publish it to the play store. I already had a rigged cat model (Pasha) and started making a few animations for a simple scrolling game featuring a kat on a unicycle jumping hurdles of random heights and collecting points.

Alien Explorer Android Game
No man sky was announced in 2013, and 3 years later we finally hear rumors of its impending release. I am fascinated by random generation. I think that at the core, the simplest player vs computer game can be boiled down to one bit: pc randomly sets the bit HIGH or LOW, the player wins if they can guess the value of the bit. The fun comes from not knowing the decisions of the computer. I started recreating a 2d fan made version of Noman*s sky concept. I designed this top-down game to creating the illusion of navigating a super large map while adhering to low end mobile phones storage limitations. Map building: By storing a minimal amount of map data in a list and constantly removing the furthest areas of the map, I can create a seemingly infinite map of randomly generated persistent planets. Game play mechanics: The player controls a spaceship* yaw and throttle to move around. The frictionless attribute of deep space is taken into account, making the ship drift in the direction of its propulsion. Planets exert a gravitational pull on the ship. Larger planets have more gravity. The player must maneuver the ship to land safely. Once landed, the player can walk around the planet to collect alien creatures. There was going to be a fuel management system, and random alien generator, but then No Man Sky was delivered at my door, and I got side tracked.

Hardware For Mobile Gaming
I haven*t played FPS pc games for a while, and it does take lots of practice to enjoy multiplayer lobbies these days. PUBG on pc was inaccessible, either because of too many hackers, or kids were just that good. Anyway, I found that PUBG was also available on mobile. At least on mobile, everyone was subject to the same clunky controls. The playing field was leveled, peripheral extensions were prohibited. I was getting pretty comfortable with PUBG mobile and was losing interest. A new weapon was introduced in the game. This weapon required a perfect shooting timing in order to maximize its firing rate. Example firing rate. The weapon is powerful, but mastering the timing was very hard. What if I build a device that could automate the firing? Such device could not be connected to the host or it would be detected, and my account would be banned. I looked at how capacitive screen work and realized I could replicate a human touch by placing a probe on the screen and grounding it to simulate a touch. I experimented with a few materials: touch pen rubber cap, aluminum pads, and copper pads. I could also bunch the probes in array formations since the PUBG UI settings allowed button placements.  I used an Arduino uno and relays to create multiple switches. I then programmed a few routines including the auto fire mode. Final Example.

Bellhop Mobile Game
A friend of mine I brainstormed an idea to build a math game for kids. We came up with the bellhop bunny after consulting with our kids. The hotel is made of multiple floors like a stack. On each floor is a little critter who needs to provide an item to a friend who lives on a different floor. The way to access the different floor is to solve an easy addition problem.  Each floor is randomly generated and the characters on the right of my generated floors follow a unique procedural animation. For example: if the animal lives in a room the room will be furnished with a random bed a bedside table a rug and items you can find in the bedroom and arrange them in a random order while leaving enough space for the Critter to walk to the front door. When the doors open with see the critter doing an action that would be generally associated with a broom such as getting up from the bed and walking to the door or getting up from their desk and walking to the door.

After getting comfortable with it I started upgrading:  I accidentally snapped the mini USB plug and had to solder it back on. I accidentally snapped it later , and this time it was unsalvageable. I decided to upgrade the bord to a 32bit processor board. This can support marlin 2.0 and extra peripheral devices such as and automatic bed leveler.  Upgraded the file transfer and printer monitoring. I had a spare raspberry pi laying around and used it to run Octoprint.

On a random Tuesday morning, I get a call from my parent*s LAN line. That was strange since they both have a cell phone and have not used the land line in years. It was my dad. He seemed panicked saying ~I called amazon*s customer service with my cell phone, and now this tech guy is moving the cursor on his laptop, and is opening weird black screens with white text^. Oh boyâ€¦ I told him to immediately power off the laptop. I knew that somehow, he got owned. Now I have to investigate ad do some damage control.  Later that week I went to my parents* house to pick up the laptop and get the full story.  My dad said that he had some issues with his monochrome Amazon KindleV1, and the kindle provided a link to amazon*s customer service. He entered the said link on his laptop*s browser, and found ~an^ Amazon customer care site that provided a phone number to call. After calling this number, he was linked to an ~Amazon^ customer service tech who asked him to download some software and follow prompts for install. After that, the tech guy went silent on the phone and started digging around on my dad*s laptop, and that*s when he called me. Investigation stage:  preparation: Id, story, vm, and network First contact: Change strategy Final call:

Universal Servo Tester
I needed a tool to test servos. It needs to be portable, have analogue and digital inputs, a display, and regulator that coud hadle the largest servo I own.

Upgrade Home Network
Everyone*s working from home and very dependent on the network. Since I do tinker with network configs I decided to segregate and consolidate our home network. I have to manage 3 IOT thermostats, 4 remote IOT switches, 6 IP cams, 2 web servers,a video strem server,  a file sharing server , a movies nas , a main network, a guest network, a vpn ,  and my networking sandbox for tinkering and developing. (update 2021_ the machine hosting my seb servers is kaput.)

You Ve Got Mail
Another fun weekend project is the mail detector equipped with a microphone that says you*ve got mail just like in the good old AOL days. When the mail man slips an envelope through the mail slot on the front door, it passes in front of a sensor which triggers an Arduino uno to play the original wave audio ~You got mail^. The wave file was converted to raw bytes and stored directly on the EEPROM. I then built simple audio amplifier using a standard OpAmp.

Pi Game Console
I wanted a way to put my Unity games on a console for my kids. Basically, I wanted to have my kids play games that I create in unity. I didn*t want they*re too young to use the computer and I would rather use something more durable listless expensive period a perfect solution so now the challenge is putting a unity game which runs on X86 based processor with a Raspberry Pi which is an arm ship period. I also wanted to create a custom-made controllers using an Arduino because I wanted to have analogue sliders since the first idea was to create pong. I tried the WebGL round which was very easy to deploy but suffers from a very small browser memory allocation period.  anything more complex that simple blocks and very small number of branded watches will not run with the current state of WebAssembly. One workaround is to edit the JSON settings file and increase the value for TOTAL_MEMORY. The WebGl people advise using 512Md. The max allowed is only 2024 and is not recommended at all. Another option to explore will be Unity Project tiny. At the moment It may not support. The goal is to build a cheap game console than can run my own unity games with my custom controllers for my kids (3 and 5) Idea: raspberry pi , Arduino controllers , custom unity games. I figured the first games would be pong and some variation of pong. I could just build the game in python and look for ways to either use the GPIO for connecting custom game controllers. The know the pi has around 40 pins, and although some are restricted, I could still have enough for 2 standard game controllers D-pad=4 buttons=4 start/select=2 LR=2 so 28 pins for two players. I still want to use a linear slider for pong and others games that could be fun to play with an analogue controller.  Optimally, I would like to have a standard controller and a linear slider. The pi does not have analogue inputs. I could use an external 14bit ADC but at this point I*m not sold on building python games. I know that in the future, the clients will be older and would want more graphically advanced games. I do know Unity pretty well, so I decided to make it a req.  Investigate ways to run unity games on pi hardware. It would be nice to have the unity editor running right on the pi. Unity editor could run on windows10 IOT â€¦ buuut. it would be unusable even with an 8gb ram. The pi has an ARM processor so there will be lots of overhead running the OS in the first place on top of unity editor â€¦ no way. It looks like I should definitely build the games on pc and then deploy them to the pi. Looking into widws10 IOT, I found that running the games only will be sluggish.  What other option do I have?  I could just run Raspbian OS and I could even have Godot game editor on it, but I*m not comfortable enough with it. Using unity, I can always build custom C  software, I*m just more comfortable with unity.  Another option would be using x86 wrapper. Back to using Raspbian: I can build WebGL games and run them in browser. Test results: can only handle 256mb games â€¦ boo. It does run like a charm on Chrome OS though. I will get back to investigating this approach as WebGL gets updated. Unity-Tiny is also something to look into. Final solution: Build game pc for Android. Make HID controllers with Arduino Leonardo. Run game on Lineage OS on pi.

Responsive Camera
During a preliminary phone interview with the robotics company, it was mentioned that they were building a mechanical device that would shadow the head movement of a person. I have to be very vague because I signed an NDA agreement. That conversation gave me an idea to for a project that I would present for my follow-up video call interview I thought I could just track a caller*s face position on my screen and control a servo motor that would be holding my camera.  When the caller moves their heads left or right my camera will pan giving the impression that they are looking through an actual window.  I worked on it for a week and it was ready for presentation. It was a very good topic of conversation and a good showcase of my skills in such a short notice.  Sadly, the company changed directions, and the position was no longer needed.
