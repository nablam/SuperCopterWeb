One day I was in a hotel bar/restaurant with my parents, and noticed an Arcade machine.

I was trying to draw in perspective but could verbalize it. The teacher kept saying that tennis courts are rectangles, and could not explain that side lines should taper toward a focal point. (I wish I could have said it this way back then…). My drawing abilities were more advanced than my peers, and so I would always be asked to draw my friends* favorite cartoon characters, which I gladly did as they were also my favorites. I had drawn two 25page ninja turtle comic books, and was crating mini flip books by drawing animated stick figures in the corners of all my school books. I was experimenting with motion, and visual language without even knowing it. I would make animations of a heavy stick figure running sluggishly, and contrast that with a thin fit stick figure lightly striding. I was also fascinated by destruction.

Game play mechanics: The player controls a spaceship* yaw and throttle to move around. The frictionless attribute of deep space is taken into account, making the ship drift in the direction of its propulsion. Planets exert a gravitational pull on the ship. Larger planets have more gravity. The player must maneuver the ship to land safely. Once landed, the player can walk around the planet to collect alien creatures. There was going to be a fuel management system, and random alien generator, but then No Man Sky was delivered at my door, and I got side tracked.

PUBG on pc was inaccessible, either because of too many hackers, or kids were just that good. Anyway, I found that PUBG was also available on mobile. At least on mobile, everyone was subject to the same clunky controls. The playing field was leveled, peripheral extensions were prohibited. I was getting pretty comfortable with PUBG mobile and was losing interest. A new weapon was introduced in the game. This weapon required a perfect shooting timing in order to maximize its firing rate. Example firing rate. The weapon is powerful, but mastering the timing was very hard. What if I build a device that could automate the firing? Such device could not be connected to the host or it would be detected, and my account would be banned. I looked at how capacitive screen work and realized I could replicate a human touch by placing a probe on the screen and grounding it to simulate a touch. I experimented with a few materials: touch pen rubber cap, aluminum pads, and copper pads. I could also bunch the probes in array formations since the PUBG UI settings allowed button placements.  I used an Arduino uno and relays to create multiple switches. I then programmed a few routines including the auto fire mode.

Basically, I wanted to have my kids play games that I create in unity. I didn*t want they*re too young to use the computer and I would rather use something more durable listless expensive period a perfect solution so now the challenge is putting a unity game which runs on X86 based processor with a Raspberry Pi which is an arm ship period. I also wanted to create a custom-made controllers using an Arduino because I wanted to have analogue sliders since the first idea was to create pong. I tried the WebGL round which was very easy to deploy but suffers from a very small browser memory allocation period.  anything more complex that simple blocks and very small number of branded watches will not run with the current state of WebAssembly. One workaround is to edit the JSON settings file and increase the value for TOTAL_MEMORY. The WebGl people advise using 512Md. The max allowed is only 2024 and is not recommended at all. Another option to explore will be Unity Project tiny https:%docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.tiny@0.16/manual/index.html  At the moment It may not support. The goal is to build a cheap game console than can run my own unity games with my custom controllers for my kids (3 and 5) Idea: raspberry pi , Arduino controllers , custom unity games. I figured the first games would be pong and some variation of pong. I could just build the game in python and look for ways to either use the GPIO for connecting custom game controllers. The know the pi has around 40 pins, and although some are restricted, I could still have enough for 2 standard game controllers D-pad=4 buttons=4 start/select=2 LR=2 so 28 pins for two players. I still want to use a linear slider for pong and others games that could be fun to play with an analogue controller.  Optimally, I would like to have a standard controller and a linear slider. The pi does not have analogue inputs. I could use an external 14bit ADC but at this point I*m not sold on building python games. I know that in the future, the clients will be older and would want more graphically advanced games. I do know Unity pretty well, so I decided to make it a req.  Investigate ways to run unity games on pi hardware. It would be nice to have the unity editor running right on the pi. Unity editor could run on windows10 IOT … buuut. it would be unusable even with an 8gb ram. The pi has an ARM processor so there will be lots of overhead running the OS in the first place on top of unity editor … no way. It looks like I should definitely build the games on pc and then deploy them to the pi. Looking into widws10 IOT, I found that running the games only will be sluggish.  What other option do I have?  I could just run Raspbian OS and I could even have Godot game editor on it, but I*m not comfortable enough with it. Using unity, I can always build custom C  software, I*m just more comfortable with unity.  Another option would be using x86 wrapper. Back to using Raspbian: I can build WebGL games and run them in browser. Test results: can only handle 256mb games … boo. It does run like a charm on Chrome OS though. I will get back to investigating this approach as WebGL gets updated. Unity-Tiny is also something to look into. Final solution: Build game pc for Android. Make HID controllers with Arduino Leonardo. Run game on Lineage OS on pi.","linkToPage":"/SelectedPages/Page_PiUnityGameConsole.html","page_lable":"lbl_52"},{"id":"53","category":"LifeTechArt","subcategory":"PublicPersonal_HardwareSoftware_ClassicCad","ctype":"personalProject_Work_Schooling","date":"2022 03","title":"Servo Panning Camera for Video Chat","photo":"","maintext_short":"","maintext_Long":"During a preliminary phone interview with the robotics company, it was mentioned that they were building a mechanical device that would shadow the head movement of a person.
